# Scalable MERN E-commerce System

A scalable **E-commerce web application** built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**.
This project demonstrates **clean backend architecture, authentication flows, modular folder structure, and scalable development practices** rather than focusing heavily on UI design.

The system supports a full **E-commerce workflow**, including product management, shopping cart functionality, order placement, invoice generation, and email notifications.

# 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

Authentication is implemented using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.

### Public Routes

* User Registration
* User Login
* Product Listing
* Product Details

### Protected Routes

* Add to Cart
* Place Order
* View Profile
* View Order History

### Admin Only Routes

* Create Product
* Update Product
* Delete Product
* Manage Orders

Role-based access control is implemented using a **`role` field** in the user schema.

Example:

```json
{
  "role": "admin"
}
```

# 🧾 Invoice Generation

When an order is placed:

1. The backend generates a **PDF invoice**.
2. The invoice includes:

   * Order ID
   * Customer Details
   * Product List
   * Quantity
   * Price per Product
   * Total Amount

The PDF is generated using:

* **PDFKit** or
* **Puppeteer**

---

# 📧 Email Notification

After a successful order:

1. The server generates the invoice.
2. The invoice PDF is attached to an email.
3. Email is sent using **Nodemailer**.

Example Email Content:

```
Subject: Order Confirmation

Your order has been successfully placed.

Please find the invoice attached.
```

---

# 🖼️ Product Image Upload

Product images are uploaded using **Multer** middleware.

Features:

* Multiple images per product
* Stored in `/uploads`
* Image path saved in MongoDB

---

# ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the backend folder.

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

EMAIL_USER=your_email
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password

CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

# 📊 Scalability Considerations

This project is structured to scale for **large applications**.

Key design practices:

* Layered architecture
* Modular services
* Separation of concerns
* Reusable middleware
* Role-based authorization
* Stateless authentication with JWT
* Clean folder structure

---

* Postman
* Thunder Client

Example endpoints:

```
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
GET  /api/products
POST /api/orders
GET  /api/orders/my-orders
```

---

# 📌 Future Improvements

Possible enhancements:

* Payment Gateway Integration (Stripe/Razorpay)
* Redis for caching carts
* Product search with Elasticsearch
* Image storage using AWS S3
* Microservices architecture
* Docker deployment
* CI/CD pipeline
